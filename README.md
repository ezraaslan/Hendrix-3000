# Hendrix-3000
An all-in-one guitar playing machine and improvisation helper. This handy machine is the perfect jam buddy. The Hendrix 3000 can create unique guitar solos with nothing but a key and a tempo. It's sensitive to user input and can change the solo key or chord in an instant. It also prints out the corresponding notes so you can follow along or recreate the improvisation yourself!

INSTUCTIONS:
Enter in an upper case chord name (eg. G) in the Chord box to start. Enter in a tempo (eg. 120) in the tempo box. Make sure sound is on so the machine can output a string of notes. Follow the instructions on the screen if you need to switch chords during the solo.
